I'm sorry for the delay in updating. In the past few months, I have suffered tremendous psychological trauma, insomnia, depression, and suicidal tendencies. I'm tired of the indifference in relationships, and 
 tired of my own cowardice. After half a year of psychotherapy, I finally have the energy to continue completing this work. I think if I can achieve some results, this will be a great encouragement to me.
